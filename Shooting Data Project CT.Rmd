This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The following code instals the tidyverse package

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

Import the "NYPD shooting incident data historic"
```{r}
url_in <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

# Import data directly from the URL
shooting_data <- read_csv(url_in)

```
Tidy up the data a little to only show the desired columns.

```{r}
# Keep only columns 2, 3s, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20
   shooting_data_subset <- shooting_data[, c(2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20)]
head(shooting_data_subset)
```
Tidy up the Dates to a more usable form.

```{r}
# Convert 'OCCUR_DATE' to Date format if not already
shooting_data_subset$OCCUR_DATE <- mdy(shooting_data_subset$OCCUR_DATE)
 
 # Extract the year from OCCUR_DATE
 shooting_data_subset$Year <- format(shooting_data_subset$OCCUR_DATE, "%Y")
 
 # Count occurrences for each year
 shooting_data_year_counts <- table(shooting_data_subset$Year)
 
 print(shooting_data_year_counts)
```
```{r}

# Create a scatter plot

# Convert the table to a data frame
shooting_data_df <- as.data.frame(shooting_data_year_counts)

# Create a scatter plot
ggplot(shooting_data_df, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Year Counts", x = "Year", y = "Counts")+
  ylim(0, max(shooting_data_df$Freq) + 10)

```


```{r}
# Calculate mean
 mean(shooting_data_year_counts)
```

```{r} 
# Calculate median
median(shooting_data_year_counts)
```
 
```{r}
# Calculate range
 range(shooting_data_year_counts)

```
```{r}
shooting_data_boro <- table(shooting_data_subset$BORO) 
print(shooting_data_boro)
```

```{r}
shooting_data_precinct <- table(shooting_data_subset$PRECINCT) 
column_counts_precinct <- table(shooting_data_subset$PRECINCT)
max(column_counts_precinct)
```

```{r}
names(column_counts_precinct)[which.max(column_counts_precinct)]
```
```{r}
shooting_data_perp_race <- table(shooting_data_subset$PERP_RACE)
shooting_data_perp_race
```
```{r}
shooting_data_vic_race <- table(shooting_data_subset$VIC_RACE)
shooting_data_vic_race
```

```{r}
# Create a two-way table using the table function
two_way_table_race <- table(shooting_data_subset$VIC_RACE, shooting_data_subset$PERP_RACE)

# Add row and column totals
two_way_table_race_with_totals <- addmargins(two_way_table_race)

# Display the table with totals
print(two_way_table_race_with_totals)
```


```{r}
shooting_data_perp_age <- shooting_data_subset %>%
  mutate(VIC_AGE_GROUP = str_trim(VIC_AGE_GROUP)) %>%
  filter(VIC_AGE_GROUP != "1020")


perp_age_table <- table(shooting_data_perp_age$VIC_AGE_GROUP)
perp_age_table
```

```{r}
shooting_data_vic_age <- table(shooting_data_subset$VIC_AGE_GROUP)
shooting_data_vic_age
```
```{r}
# Create a two-way table using the table function
two_way_table_age <- table(shooting_data_subset$VIC_AGE_GROUP, shooting_data_subset$PERP_AGE_GROUP)

# Add row and column totals
two_way_table_age_with_totals <- addmargins(two_way_table_age)

# Display the table with totals
print(two_way_table_age_with_totals)
```
```{r}
# Load ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Create a scatter plot using specific columns
ggplot(shooting_data_subset, aes(x = OCCUR_DATE, y = PRECINCT)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot", x = "Year", y = "Precinct")
```
```{r}
# Cumulative Frequency Plot
ggplot(shooting_data_subset, aes(x = OCCUR_DATE)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step", aes(y = ..y..)) +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Frequency Plot", x = "Date", y = "Cumulative Frequency")
```


This creates a heat map of sorts
```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
``` 

Conclusion:
Based on the scatter plot, it looked like gun crime was on the decline until 2019 and then it spiked back up. More research will need to be conducted to identify any causality.  I was biased going into this assignment, probably by news reports and the fact that I was mugged by a young black man once.  I dealt with this biased by letting the data speak for it self.  What all of this doesn't show is causality.  The data, for unknown reasons, shows that young black on black crime in New York City is the most prevalent.  

Side note.  Here is my attempt to create a heat map.  It sort of worked.  It doesn't show up in the Knit. But if you run the code in R it works.  Not how I wanted it though.  It will take a little more time to sort it out properly.  It probably needs TABLEUA.

```{r}
 map <- leaflet(shooting_data_subset) %>%
     addTiles()  
 
 
 map <- map %>%
     addMarkers(
         lng = ~Longitude,
         lat = ~Latitude,
         options = markerOptions(
             radius = 1,  # Adjust the radius as needed
             opacity = 0.7,
             fillOpacity = 0.7,
             heatmapOptions = list(radius = 5)  # Adjust the heatmap radius as needed
         )
     )

 ```
